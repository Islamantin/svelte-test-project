# Svelte Test Project

This is a simple learning project to familiarize myself with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) framework.

## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
cd svelte-app
npm install
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). You should see your app running.
